# Architype - A Turn-Based RPG Strategy Game
## Table of Contents
## Concept
This game is a take on the turn-based RPG fighting games like Pokemon, Darkest Dungeon, Etrian Odyssey, etc. Players choose up to 5 characters based on `Queer Architypes` to build a party. With this party, they can either fight against monsters in story/endless mode or other player parties in pvp mode. 

## Story
Evil is among us.

You start off with 5 default classes:
    - Barista: High usage of burn attacks
    - Biker: High damage and high speed. Can provide small burst heal.
    - Drag Queen: Strong and defensive with lots of CC abilities. Very slow.
    - Emo: Balanced character with lots of buffs, debuffs. Can heal.
    - Jock: High burst damage, speed, crit chance, and dodge.

## Coding
### Design Patterns
In my previous project, I had a lot of practice with different backend technologies such as message queues, real-time communication, authentication, authoritzation, etc. Although impressive to learn, I needed to take a step back and remind myself of other coding techniques. Starting this new project, I wanted to apply more of a focus into different design patterns used. 

Some of the different deisgn patterns I used included:
- [Registry Pattern](#registry-pattern)
- [Decorator Pattern](#decorator-pattern)
- [Factory Pattern](#factory-pattern)
- [Template Method Pattern](#template-method-pattern)
- [Strategy Pattern](#strategy-pattern)
- [Composition](#composition)
- [Observer Pattern (working on it)](#observer-pattern)
- [Enum Pattern](#enum-pattern)
- [Builder Pattern (working on it)](#builder-pattern)
- [Data Transfer Object (DTO) Pattern](#dto-pattern)
#### Registry Pattern
The `Registry Pattern` is a structural design pattern used to centralize the management of shared objects or service instances within an application. It acts as a central repository/dictionary where objects are stored, registered, and retrieved using unique identifiers.

In this project
#### Decorator Pattern
#### Factory Pattern
#### Template Method Pattern
#### Strategy Pattern
#### Composition
#### Observer Pattern
#### Enum Pattern
#### Builder Pattern
#### DTO Pattern
